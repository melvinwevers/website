During my stay as a researcher-in-residence at the KB, I applied techniques from the field of Computer Vision to gain insights into non-textual trends in the Dutch advertisements landscape. The research produced a [dataset of advertisements](http://lab.kb.nl/dataset/siameset) as well as a tool ([SIAMESE](http://lab.kb.nl/tool/siamese)) to find visually similar images in a large corpus of advertisements. You can read more about the project [here](http://lab.kb.nl/about-us/blog/find-what-you-were-looking-using-neural-networks-trawl-through-newspaper).
