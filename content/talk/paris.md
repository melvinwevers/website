abstract_short = "The first part of the talk will provide a short overview of computer vision techniques. Through a focus on the recent developments of deep learning, we will try to bring intuitions on the way these powerful algorithms represent the visual information, before presenting potential applications to the Humanities in general, from handwritten documents to photo archives. The second part of the talk will use the digitized newspaper collection of the National Library of the Netherlands as an example and show how to extract images from this collection. Next, we will give three case studies that show how deep learning can be applied to answer historical questions. First, we will show how photographs can be separated from illustrations; second, how images can be clustered based on their visual similarity; and finally, how we detect objects in images? Finally, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities of working with deep learning on historical image collections"
