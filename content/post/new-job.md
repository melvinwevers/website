As of October 1, 2017, I am working as researcher in the Digital Humanities Group of the KNAW Humanities Cluster. Together with teamleader Marieke van Erp and fellow researcher Adina Nerghes, we will form collaborations with researcher in the three research institutes within the KNAW Humanities Cluster. I will post updates once I have some projects up and running at my new job.
