# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Digital Humanities Lab at the KNAW Humanities Cluster. My research interests include the study of cultural-historical phenomena using computational means with a specific interest in the formation and evolution of ideas and concepts in public discourse. Oh, and I really like to study advertisements and consumer products.
